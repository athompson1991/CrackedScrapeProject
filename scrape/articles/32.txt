A name is everything. You could invent a product that ends world hunger, but if it's called "Speckled Fart Rice," chances are great that no one is going to buy it. Still though, some product names just aren't descriptive enough, which is why we've asked our readers to do a little rebranding. (Companies can send checks to our offices for their inevitable boost in sales.) by bazooka by OlPiley by TheDED1 by OlPiley by Chan Teik Onn by OlPiley by mrlarry by OlPiley by Scott Laffey by TheDED1 by bazooka by TheDED1 by OlPiley by Girz by Nerfherder247 by Scott Laffey by ColorMe_Yosh by Vicki Veritas by bazooka by OlPiley by 404notfound by OlPiley Congrats, Phighter.
