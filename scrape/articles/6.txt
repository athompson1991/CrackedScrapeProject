When the math adds up, the numbers never lie. They're infallible, concrete, impossible to argue with -- however you want to spin it, they make one solid point. Oh, wait -- did we say spin? Yes, spin. As you're about to find out, it turns out that even innocent statistics can be twisted to support any nefarious thing you want to prove. Guess numbers do lie and we were right for never going to our math classes. by milito by PJ7 by gicusudoru by Scott Laffey by LilySprite by milito by jaoafallas by ShortUsername01 by jaoafallas by Michael Voll by PJ7 by Comunacho by Michael Voll by jaoafallas by CZM by Chan Teik Onn by Maclise by ShortUsername01 Congrats, Randallw.
