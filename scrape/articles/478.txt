Let me first be clear that BuzzFeed has done some very insightful, interesting interviews. And just look at their news section -- they do news. But then there's the other thing. The "19 Reasons Raisins Should Be Put in Jail" and "Is This a Disney Movie?" I understand, of course. Post what people will click on. We all do it. It's what I'm doing right now. But lately it looks like we've run out of things to remember. Things to talk about. I'm pretty sure I recently typed "19 Reasons Raisins Should Be Put in Jail," and I didn't make it up, nor this piece literally commanding me to stop what I'm doing so I will read it. I worry that very soon, BuzzFeed (but again, not only BuzzFeed) will look like this ...                       Cody is a columnist, video editor, writer, and performer for Cracked.com, a site that, yes, he's aware has lists, but that's not what this piece was about, so there's no need to point that out. Anyway, you can find him on Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr and probably some fucking stupid new thing called Blankyarm or TrendFriender.   Copyright ©2016 Cracked is a Scripps company brand
