Figuring out people is super tough. And it's even tougher in a world where we are increasingly find more and more ways not to interact with human beings on a face-to-face level. Fortunately for you we teamed up with the always amazing AuntieMeme to put together a "How To" on basic human behavior. Print it out, make a book, and stick it in your pocket so you'll never be caught with your pants down the next time you're talking to the face of an actual person. by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme by AuntieMeme Congrats, AuntieMeme.
