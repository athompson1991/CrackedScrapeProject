When it comes to video game innovation, people mostly talk about graphics or ingenious gameplay mechanics or the ability to make characters with supernaturally perfect bodies. But we expect innovation in those areas, while other, less flashy, less important parts of the gaming experience go years without seeing a single impressive or, hell, even noticeable change. Luckily, some game developers out there took the time to do something different with those areas -- areas that are too often an afterthought and typically seem as if they came pre-fabricated out of a box and were glued on at the last second. For instance ...  With its inauthentic punk rock, in-your-face attitude, Sunset Overdrive is the Avril Lavigne of video games. It's like your grandma doing "cool" hip hop hand gestures while telling you how she don't love them hoes. But it has two great things going for it: 1) the gameplay, which is a ridiculous but well-implemented mix of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Ratchet And Clank, and 2) its respawn animations. 
Avril herself is just a series of poorly configured ones and zeroes. In most games, you're thrown back into the action, without flair, without a big to-do. In seconds you go from death to picking up where you left off before you were gutted by a giant Nazi pig monster. In Sunset Overdrive, failing to survive -- the most basic goal of most games -- is rewarded with one of nearly 20 exceedingly silly respawn animations, nearly all of which are pop culture references. You die and return by popping out of the ground in Bill and Ted's phone booth:  Or via Portal gun:  Or by crawling out of a TV like in The Ring:  The respawn is almost never a place where game developers see a need to do something different. That's understandable, too. In most cases, it's probably best to get the players back into the action as quickly as possible. In a game like Hotline Miami, where dying a trillion times per level is part of the experience, a fancy respawn would only make things more frustrating. Long gaps between death and rebirth throw off a player's rhythm, getting them out of "the zone." But Sunset Overdrive isn't a game where you have to develop a rhythm. You jump around and grind on stuff and you kill, leaving plenty of room to wedge in a little shot of entertaining innovation. And besides -- I really don't think I have to explain why dying and coming back in a Back To The Future-esque time machine sports car is amazing, do I?   For a while, the closest load screens ever came to being interesting was when someone decided to slap on some random production art stills instead of a black screen with a spinning disc in the bottom corner. Then came Resident Evil, which masked its loads with the suspenseful opening of a door, adding a hint of dread to what in less capable hands could have been more nothing.  After Resident Evil used the blank canvas of the loading screen to keep the player engaged, no one really tried to follow it up. More production art, and then maybe bite-sized nuggets of game lore. At the very best, the load screen gave tips on how to play the game: gentle reminders of features you may not be using, the benefits of certain collectible items -- really basic stuff you completely ignored or were too busy hitting "skip" to read the first time around. And then came Bayonetta. Bayonetta's loading screens actually attempted to have a function, a real purpose that kept players engaged, even while the console was booting up the next chunk of the game. Rather than giving you time to pick your nose or reach for another fistful of chips, Bayonetta let players practice combos in a kind of virtual dojo during the loading screens between chapters.  Third-person action games rely on combos or button-mashing, and for some outdated reason the player is always required to learn on the job, while playing the main story. In a fighting game, players can practice their moves in a mode separate from the main game. It's a stress-free environment that allows the player to learn the moves at their own pace. All Bayonetta did was take that same idea and apply it to that usually useless space where the player would normally fill time by listening to the game disc rotate and contemplating the fragility of his own mortality.

**tsk-tsk-tsk ... MrrMrr** Resident Evil and Bayonetta have one thing in common other than innovative uses of loading screens: Hideki Kamiya, a game designer who worked on the original Resident Evil, was the director of Resident Evil 2 and the Bayonetta series, and is the only man alive who gives a shit about loading screens ... or it could be because the game industry is filled with dickhead corporations that actually prevent their innovation.

A good main menu has words on it. Words like "New Game" and "Continue" and "Settings." Sometimes, the really high-end ones have moving pictures and even the title of the game. All right, it's not that hard to make a good main menu. They're 100 percent function. Clickable words that lead to more clickable words. They're dull PowerPoint slides that hold back all the fun you're about to experience. They don't need to be fancy or do anything special. It's just the game's chance to prove it can at least function, if nothing else. 
We stopped all menu innovation in 1985. Even with all that in mind, there are still some people out there that actually give a damn about doing something special with a main menu. The rally racing sim DiRT 2 forgoes the PowerPoint menu by placing the player in the middle of a rally event. The menu is in first-person, from the perspective of your driver as he hangs out in his RV. The festival atmosphere of the rally can be heard through the walls and seen through the windows. Looking around the trailer gives you the options to choose your race location on a map splayed out on a table, watch race footage on the RV's TV, or quit the game by walking into the bedroom. The only thing it's missing is a group of drunk rednecks in the audience, fist-fighting each other over the last pork rind.  Walking outside the trailer accesses more menu options, but now you're in the middle of the race festivities. There's a giant inflatable air guy dancing around. Race attendees walk from one promotional tent to another. Your crew hangs out, waiting for the race to start. The main menu puts you in the middle of a small but immersive world. Modifying your car doesn't take you to a separate garage area that might as well be floating somewhere off in space. You walk outside your RV and there it is -- your car, just sitting there, ready to be modified. Even cooler: The menu location changes depending on which city you're racing in. You race in London, your crew hangs out in London:  Race in Malaysia and the main menu goes to Malaysia with you:  It ultimately functions in the exact same way as every other game menu, but extra care and attention was given to make it feel like you're in the middle of something larger. To make it feel like an experience and not just a game. On the other hand, creating an innovative take on an often-neglected part of a video game can be as simple as turning that thing into a game itself, like how ...  Generally, the greatest innovation video game end credit sequences have seen is the ability to fast-forward through them or skip them entirely. Great, you gave players the ability to completely bypass the part where the people who worked insane hours and sacrificed so much of their lives to make the game get the literal credit they deserve. Here's a medal for your achievement: Thomas Northcut/Digital Vision/Getty Images Luckily, back in 1999, a tiny seed of end credit innovation was planted in the first Super Smash Bros., for the Nintendo 64, and it didn't fully bloom until the recently released Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. After beating the original Smash Bros., and a moment or two before the end credits rolled, a targeting reticle appeared on screen. When the credits started rolling, targeting a name would display the specific work that Nintendo employee contributed to the game in a box in the top right.  It's a deconstructed credit sequence. It serves the same purpose it always has, just presented with a touch of originality. A few years later, Super Smash Bros. Melee, for the GameCube, took the targeting reticle idea from the original and expanded it. Now the player was in the cockpit of a starship zipping through space, firing at the credits flying toward the screen. Same idea as before but fancier, and now with an added competitive element: It kept score. The end credit sequence was now, officially, a game in itself.  Then the development team remembered that Smash is a fighting game, not a flight sim, so in the Wii U Super Smash Bros. you beat the hell out of the end credits with the character you just used to tear through the single-player campaign, special power-up items and all.  To make it even more competitive than the end-credit slaughtering of Melee, the Wii U version's barehanded credit massacre slowly reveals an unlockable image of the character you're playing. Each percentage of the image revealed gives the player a gold coin they can spend on in-game goodies. By the fourth game in the series, the end credits became as rewarding as the game itself. Nintendo, stop teasing us and just release the hyper-violent murder-simulator game starring the Smash Bros. end-credit sequence you've been hinting at for nearly two decades.
