Do you hate your job? Feel like you've hit a dead end? Stuck doing menial tasks while your brain slowly melts from boredom? If you can't find a way out, then all we can say is step your fucking game up, man. It turns out there's all sorts of people the world over who took normal jobs the rest of society would dread going to everyday and decided to become the best at that shit. So the next time you're complaining about how bored you are at work, just realize that these people were probably in the same spot as you. by Anavi by John E. by Randallw by adiplotti by adiplotti by Anavi by BRWombat by adiplotti by Anavi by milito by adiplotti by adiplotti by adiplotti by John E. by adiplotti by adiplotti by adiplotti Congrats, adiplotti.
