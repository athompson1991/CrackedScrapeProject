 Newsflash: You only have 407 days until the 2016 presidential election. Do you think you'll have enough time to make an informed decision? We think so. In fact, you could bury your head in the sand on Mars for another full year and still have enough time to suss out which candidate you think should be the leader of the free world. But why, over 13 months out, is every news outlet leading with an election story like it's coming up tomorrow and we still have approximately 45,000 candidates? Why are no serious Republican candidates calling out Trump for being a rodeo clown in a fancy suit? And why do people think Donald Trump can win when -- spoiler alert -- he's not going to become President? Dan O'Brien is joined this week by Cracked editors Kristi Harrison and Alex Schmidt to answer these burning questions and remind you that what's going on with the presidential election right now is a total farce; you can go back to your normal business until February 2016 at the earliest.

If you're afraid big corporations will one day try to beam ideas directly into your mind, too late. On this special BONUS episode of The Cracked Podcast, we've got no mind-blowing views about social anthropology or insane fan-theories about how many Martys died for 'Back to the Future' to make sense. In the grand scheme of human history, awareness of mental health issues is a relatively recent development. We tend to think of the class system as money thing.
